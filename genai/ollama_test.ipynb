    "Abdominal Ultrasound: No evidence of gallstones or other abnormalities. Liver appears slightly enlarged.\n",
    "CT Scan of the Abdomen: Reveals a mass in the liver, approximately 5 cm in diameter. The mass appears to be enhancing on contrast.\n",
    "VI. Assessment and Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the patient's symptoms, physical examination, and diagnostic investigations, the following assessment and plan have been formulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "Assessment:\n",
    "\n",
    "Unexplained weight loss and fatigue.\n",
    "Right upper quadrant abdominal pain.\n",
    "Elevated liver enzymes and an enlarging liver mass.\n",
    "Plan:\n",
    "\n",
    "Further Evaluation: Given the presence of an enlarging liver mass and elevated liver enzymes, the patient will be referred to a gastroenterologist for further evaluation, including possible liver biopsy.\n",
    "Oncology Consultation: Given the possibility of malignancy, an oncology consultation will be sought to determine the nature of the liver mass and develop an appropriate treatment plan.\n",
    "Symptom Management: The patient's abdominal pain will be managed with pain relievers as needed. Anti-nausea medication will be prescribed to alleviate nausea symptoms.\n",
    "Nutritional Support: The patient's decreased appetite and weight loss will be addressed with dietary counseling and nutritional support to ensure adequate calorie intake.\n",
    "Psychological Support: Given the patient's stress and anxiety related to his symptoms, psychological support and counseling will be offered to address emotional well-being.\n",

    "\n",
    "The patient is scheduled for a follow-up appointment in two weeks to discuss the results of further investigations, consultations, and to address any ongoing symptoms. The patient is advised to monitor his symptoms and report any significant changes or new symptoms before the next visit.\n",
    "\n",
    "VIII. Prognosis and Discussion:\n",
    "\n",
    "The presence of an enlarging liver mass raises concerns about potential malignancy. Further diagnostic testing and consultations with specialists are essential to determine the nature of the mass and develop an appropriate treatment plan. The patient's overall prognosis will be influenced by the nature of the liver mass and the success of treatment interventions. Close collaboration between the patient, medical team, and specialists will guide the management of his condition and optimize his chances of recovery.\n",
    "\n",
    "IX. Patient Education:\n",
    "\n",
    "The patient and his family will receive comprehensive education about the diagnostic process, potential treatment options, and the importance of adhering to medical recommendations.
